App Workshop will serve as a hands-on intensive course to build
high-quality Urbit apps ready for end users.  It serves as a follow-on
to App School with more focus on building complex apps.

By completing App Workshop as a cohort student, you should be able to
produce sophisticated production-quality apps and app suites that
leverage Urbit's platform.

The first cohort for App Workshop Live will take place in late 2023.
