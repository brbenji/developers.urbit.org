The Urbit Foundation offers live, cohort-based classes to cover the [App
School](/guides/core/app-school) curriculum.

Every userspace Urbit application is a **Gall agent**. App School teaches you all about Urbit-based backend design using Gall agents, as well as interfacing with a React-based front-end.  When you're done, you'll be able to produce and distribute your own Urbit apps.

If you enjoy learning as part of a group with a hands-on instructor, regular
exercises and discussions, and a completion certification, then App School Live
will be a good fit for you.

By completing App School, you will have the basic skillset to design and implement apps, pick up Urbit userspace bounties, and participate in Hackathons.

The next cohort for App School Live will begin the week of August 21st, 2023.
