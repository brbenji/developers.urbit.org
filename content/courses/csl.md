The Urbit Foundation will offer a cohort classes to train new core developers.
Most core developers have been trained up on-the-job inside of Tlon, but as
core development expands, other organizations will contribute.

Core Academy prepares experienced Hoon developers to work on the Arvo kernel,
the Vere or New Mars runtime, and otherwise build the platform as a senior
developer.

By completing Core Academy as a cohort student, you should be able to compose a
new vane, contribute to Urbit as a core platform and infrastructure developer,
and guide in-depth projects with minimal oversight (as distinct from
collaboration).

- [Complete this form](https://airtable.com/shr6V87yXZxJEZqyu) to sign up for Core Academy before August 6th.

Until then, feel free to work through the [Arvo docs](/reference/arvo).
