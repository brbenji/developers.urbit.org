**Zuse** is a utility library included with the
[kernel](/reference/glossary/kernel) at `/sys/zuse.hoon` in the `%base`
[desk](/reference/glossary/zuse). Zuse contains a large number of useful
functions, most prominently those relating to cryptography and HTML/JSON
parsing/printing.

Zuse is the farthest downstream component of the kernel in terms of dependency,
so its version number is used to represent the version of the kernel as a whole.
